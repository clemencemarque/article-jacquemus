			To represent the authentic spirit of the brand, the creator wanted to honor one of the women in his life. 
			Liline (here in the pictures), Simon's grandmother, she became for a moment the muse for the new Jacquemus campaign for the summer 2020 collection. The designer took advantage of it by deploying the #Jacquemusathome referred to the moment of quarantine related to the health crisis, it shows the example of the rules to be respected by the public, at the same time shows a new way to communicate on fashion.

		<h2>The brand's marketing strategy</h2>
		<h4>A digital native brand</h4>
		<h5>" Instagram is my brain, unfiltered. It's very personal. It's a whole. 
			<br>
			Sometimes I post things I shouldn't put on, but I can't help it. "</h5>


		<div class="card-1">
			<div class="text">
				<p>
				Jacquemus is a "digital native" brand.  These web-born brands have the ability to fully capture and understand the behaviour of new audiences because they have used the Internet as a listening organ. It's by paying attention to what it's said on social media that they have identified available e-commerce niche markets. Jacquemus is one of those brands that are totally user centric, which means that they are globally connected to their targets.
			<br>
				Also, far from the perfect images of traditional luxury homes, Jacquemus imposes a cool, simple, provincial style. Nature pictures are combined with fashion shows and festive evenings with friends. It is through this free tone that Simon expresses himself, he doesn't skimp on familiar words, emojis and hashtags.

			<h4>Instagram as a diary</h4>
			<p>
			The power of Jacquemus is its Instagram page, like a diary of the creator and the brand. The designer stages himself in his own creations, with members of his family or his creative teams. Behind this idea, we find a communication that is more direct and warm, a simple tone that knows how to make itself accessible.  
			It shows a desire to democratize luxury clothing and accessories to make it more human and social.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text2">
				<h4>The heart of the digital stars</h4>
				<p>
					The brand is notable for its skillful manipulation of social media. The marketing strategy is to acquire customers through this channel. The brand has over 2.6 million subscribers on Instagram that it can target and interact with.
					Jacquemus has seduced some of today's biggest stars who influence Instagram users such as Emily Ratajkowski (here in the picture), Rosalia, Beyonce, Bella Hadid, Kylie Jenner... He loves these icons like a part of his family. 
					If he likes them so much, it's because these great digital influencers made such a major impact on the growth of the brand's reputation over the last four years. In the same way, if the young designer has caught the eye of these famous idols, it's because he has also been able to create strong pieces that which do not leave his customers and the media indifferent.
